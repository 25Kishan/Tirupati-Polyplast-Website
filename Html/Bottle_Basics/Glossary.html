Head space may also refer to the amount of space in a corrugated shipper carton filled with plastic bottles or jars.</p>
    
    <p><b style="color:#ED3237;">HEAVY GRAM BOTTLES</b> – Bottles blown from a parison or preform to a size that is relatively small for the parison’s/preform’s normal capacity.

Consumers open a J-Cap closure by removing a strip of plastic holding the top of the closure to the base of the closure, leaving a hinged, snap-top closure mechanism. This type of closure can also provide tamper evidence. </p>
    
    <p><b style="color:#ED3237;">LABEL PANEL</b> – The flat area of the bottle’s body where a pressure sensitive label or screen printing can be applied. Some of Alpha’s bottles feature indented label panels that help prevent scuffing of the labels. </p>

    <p><b style="color:#ED3237;">NECK FINISH</b> – The plastic surrounding the opening of a bottle shaped to accommodate a specific closure. It’s the portion of the neck that carries the threads, lugs or friction fit members to which the closure is applied, and includes the sealing surface and sealing bead; generally, the whole portion above the transfer or pry-off bead. Alpha makes continuous thread (C/T) necks for twist-on caps, and Hinge-Guard (J-Cap) necks for snap-on caps. </p>
    
    <p><b style="color:#ED3237;">NECK INSERT</b> – Part of the mold assembly that forms the neck and finish. Sometimes called the “neck ring.” </p>

    <p><b style="color:#ED3237;">PINCH-OFF</b> – A raised edge around the cavity in the mold, which seals off the part and separates the excess material as the mold closes around the parison in the extrusion blow molding operation. </p>
    
    <p><b style="color:#ED3237;">PLA – Polylactide</b> – A corn-based resin made by NatureWorks PLA that goes by the brand name IngeoTM. This compostable resin requires significantly less energy to mold into plastic containers.

In 2-stage stretch blow molding, the preform is cooled for storage; when it is needed, the tube is re-heated and inflated while inside a Blow Mold to create the shape of the desired bottle or jar. In single-stage injection stretch blow molding, the preform is formed immediately prior to being placed in the blow molding station without cooling down.</p>
    
    <p><b style="color:#ED3237;">PROTOTYPE MOLD</b> – A simplified mold construction often made from a light-casting alloy or from epoxy resin in order to obtain information for the final mold or part design. </p>
